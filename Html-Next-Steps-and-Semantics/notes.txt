-Div is a container that is block.
-Span is a container that is inline.

Extra Elements:
-<hr> Is a horizontal rule or line.
-<br> Is a line break.
-<sup> is super script
-<sub> is subscript

Entity Codes
-Used to display reserved characters
-Difficult to type characters
-starts with & and ends with;

&lt; = less than <
&gt; = greater than >
&amp; = &

We normally can't type > or < in html. They also have entity numbers. Easier to just look up what you need.
